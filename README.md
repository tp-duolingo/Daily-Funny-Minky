# Daily Funny Minky

This is a simple Discord bot that sends a cat image taken from <https://minky.materii.dev/> every day on a specific time.
(this is also my first ever project ðŸŽ‰)

## Configuration

To configure the bot, you need to change the following variables in the code:

- `TOKEN`: Replace with your own bot token.
- `CHANNEL_ID`: Replace with your own channel ID.
- `WEBSITE_URL`: Replace with the website URL you want to fetch the cat images from. I recommend leaving it as it is (minky is cool) or find a website that has cat images only.
- `target_time`: Replace with the time you want. It's based off UTC.
